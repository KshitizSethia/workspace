The tarfile comes with a set of generated outputfiles.
You can see which options were used for each of the 
files.

The script  ./runit_genclass.sh ./outputs mmu-executable
was used to generate this output.

You can generate the same output for your executable
using the same script (just provide a different executable).
and a different output directory.

After that you can run 
./gradeit.sh ./outputs ./myoutputs 
to see how you are doing in the grading.

In the final testing. More input files and different
combinations of frames will be used.

Due to space I can not provide more detailed 
outputs for large input files ...
