For IN O

The DT I
new JJ I

would MD O
be VB O
similar JJ O
to TO O
a DT I

The DT I

is VBZ O
that IN O

would MD O

retain VB O
majority NN I

The DT I

how WRB O

One CD I

the DT B

some DT I

The DT I

eventually RB O

under IN O
some DT I

But CC O
Citicorp NNP I

On IN O

likely JJ O

One CD I
advantage NN I
the DT B

Mr. NNP I

`` `` O

Mr. NNP I

his PRP$ I

It PRP I

it PRP I

Mr. NNP I

the DT I

`` `` O

One CD I

Mr. NNP I

And CC O
even RB O
when WRB O

acceptable JJ O
to TO O

This DT I

probably RB O

unscrupulous JJ I

no DT I

With IN O
a DT I

What WP I

First RB O

Shorn VBN O

insurance NN I

can MD O
still RB O
be VB O
grouped VBN O
under IN O
two CD I
broad JJ I
categories NNS I
: : O
so-called JJ I
pure JJ I
insurance NN I
, , O
which WDT I
amasses VBZ O
no DT I

value NN I
in IN O
the DT I

and CC O

only RB O
upon IN O
death NN I
, , O
and CC O
permanent JJ I
insurance NN I
, , O
which WDT I
provides VBZ O
not RB O
only RB O
a DT I
death NN I
benefit NN I
but CC O
also RB O
a DT I
cash NN I
value NN I
in IN O
the DT I
policy NN I
that WDT B
can MD O
be VB O
used VBN O
in IN O
various JJ I
ways NNS I
while IN O
the DT I
insured VBN I
is VBZ O
still RB O
alive JJ O
. . O

If IN O
all DT I
you PRP B
want VBP O
is VBZ O
death-benefit JJ I
coverage NN I
, , O
pure JJ I
insurance NN I
-- : O
a DT I
term NN I

-- : O
gives VBZ O
you PRP I
maximum JJ B
bang NN I
for IN O
your PRP$ I

, , O
within IN O
limits NNS I

It PRP I
's VBZ O
much RB O
cheaper JJR O
than IN O
permanent JJ I
insurance NN I
bought VBD O
at IN O
the DT I
same JJ I
age NN I
. . O

But CC O
`` `` O
term NN I
'' '' O
means VBZ O
just RB I
that IN I
; : O
the DT I
policy NN I
is VBZ O
written VBN O
for IN O
a DT I
specific JJ I
time NN I
period NN I
only RB I
and CC O
must MD O
be VB O
renewed VBN O
when WRB O
it PRP I
expires VBZ O
. . O

It PRP I
may MD O
also RB O
stipulate VB O
that IN O
the DT I
insured VBN I
must MD O
pass VB O
another DT I
medical JJ I
exam NN I
before IN O
renewal NN I
; : O
if IN O
you PRP I
flunk VBP O
-- : O
which WDT I
means VBZ O
you PRP I
need VBP O
insurance NN I
more JJR O
than IN O
ever RB O
-- : O
you PRP I
may MD O
not RB O
be VB O
able JJ O
to TO O

Even RB O
if IN O
you PRP I
're VBP O
healthy JJ O
and CC O
can MD O
renew VB O
, , O
your PRP$ I
premium NN I
will MD O
go VB O
up IN O
sharply RB O
because IN O
you PRP I
're VBP O
that IN I
much RB O
older JJR O

So RB O
term VBP I

may MD O
not RB O
be VB O
as RB O
cheap JJ O
as IN O
it PRP I
looks VBZ O

There EX I

One CD I
variation NN I
that WDT B
appealed VBD O
to TO O

at IN O
first JJ I
was VBD O
the DT I

Upon IN O

however RB O

whether IN O

Amex NNP I

no DT I

Second JJ O

the DT I

would MD O
be VB O
much RB O

on IN O
my PRP$ I

income NN I
that WDT B
would MD O
have VB O
exceeded VBN O
the DT I
inflation NN I
rate NN I
and CC O
thus RB O
given VBN O
the DT I
company NN I
a DT B
real JJ I

Third NNP O
and CC O
most RBS O
important JJ O
, , O
Amex NNP I
would MD O
charge VB O
me PRP I
a DT B
far RB I
higher JJR I
premium NN I
than IN O
other JJ I
reputable JJ I

would MD O

straight JJ I

for IN O
the DT I
same JJ I
amount NN I

I PRP I
'd MD O
be VB O
paying VBG O
so RB O
heavily RB O
just RB O
to TO O
have VB O
the DT I
option NN I
of IN O
getting VBG O
my PRP$ I

back RB O
that IN O

'd MD O
almost RB O
have VB O

cancel VB O
to TO O
make VB O
the DT I
whole JJ I

worthwhile JJ O

That DT I
would MD O
be VB O
all DT O
right NN O
with IN O
Amex NNP I
, , O
which WDT I
could MD O
then RB O
lock VB O
in IN O
its PRP$ I

but CC O
it PRP I
does VBZ O

add VB O
up IN O

a DT I
`` `` I

Which WDT I
goes VBZ O

show VB O

the DT I
First NNP I

: : O

And CC O
the DT I
Second NNP I
Law NNP I

unique JJ O

If IN O

a DT I

if IN O

the DT I

Always RB O

This DT I
is VBZ O
worth JJ O
remembering NN I
when WRB O
insurers NNS I
and CC O
their PRP$ I
salesmen NNS I
try VBP O
to TO O
sell VB O
you PRP I
permanent JJ B
insurance NN I
, , O
the DT I
kind NN I
that WDT B
amasses VBZ O
cash NN I

The DT I
word NN I
`` `` I
death NN I

can MD O
not RB O
be VB O
escaped VBN O
entirely RB O
by IN O
the DT I
industry NN I

dodge VBP O
it PRP I
wherever WRB O
possible JJ O

to TO O
talk VB O
about IN O
`` `` I

and CC I
`` `` I

'' '' I
instead RB O

The DT I
implication NN I
is VBZ O
that IN O
your PRP$ I
permanent-insurance JJ I
policy NN I
is VBZ O
really RB O
some DT I
kind NN I
of IN O
CD NNP I
or CC O
mutual-fund JJ I

with IN O
an DT I
added VBN I

That DT I
is VBZ O
gilding NN O
the DT I

The DT I
fact NN I
is VBZ O
that IN O
as IN O
a DT I
savings NNS I

insurance NN I
generally RB O
runs VBZ O
a DT I
poor JJ I

you PRP B
might MD O
make VB O
in IN O
the DT I
same JJ I
things NNS I
the DT B
insurance NN I
company NN I
is VBZ O
putting VBG O
your PRP$ I
money NN I
into IN O

That DT I
's VBZ O
because IN O
you PRP I
have VBP O
to TO O
pay VB O
for IN O
the DT I
insurance NN I
portion NN I
of IN O
the DT I

and CC O
the DT I
effort NN I
required VBN O
to TO O
sell VB O
and CC O

the DT I
whole JJ I
package NN I

Again RB O
, , O
no DT I

This DT I
is VBZ O
reflected VBN O
in IN O
a DT I
built-in JJ I
mortality NN I

who WP B
had VBD O
the DT I
effrontery NN I
to TO O
die VB O
while IN O

And CC O
in IN O
most RBS I

a DT I
huge JJ I

So RB O
view VBP O
